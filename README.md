# Django Voting App

This is my implementation of the Django documentation tutorial.

To run the site, clone this repository and cd into the mysite directory containing manage.py. Then, run the following command:

$ python manage.py runserver

The server should now be up!

Go to <a>http://localhost:8000/polls/</a> to checkout the simple voting app built with Django!
