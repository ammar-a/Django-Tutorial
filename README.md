Django-Tutorial 
This is my implementation of the Django documentation tutorial.

To run the site, clone this repository and cd into the mysite directory containing manage.py. Then, run the following command:

$ python manage.py runserver

The server should now be up!

Go to http://localhost:8000/polls/ to checkout the simple voting app built with Django!
